# [MERN Shopping List](https://serene-garden-10704.herokuapp.com/)
A digital shopping list web application created with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

Check out the live app [here](https://serene-garden-10704.herokuapp.com/)!

## Motivation
I created this site because I wanted to learn how to build a fullstack web application using a JavaScript front and backend. I decided on the MERN stack, and used [Brad Traversy's YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE) to help me along the way. The app authorizes users to sign-in to a shopping list where they can add and remove items. The interface was created to be mobile friendly and responsive on all devices.
